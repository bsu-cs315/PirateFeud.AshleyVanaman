# Self Reflection: 
One of my biggest issues with this was that my GoDot engine would not start. The engine would give me an error. Therefore, I kept having major setbacks on my project with having to restart the whole thing several times. Aside from that, having the game actually be able to use a projectile was really satisfying.
